== Openshift Enterprise Specific notes

If you wish to perform an Openshift Enterprise install you should set ose_version appropriately as this will
assist in ensuring supported configurations.

While this module will assist in providing supported configruations please refer to Openshift Enterprise
Deployment Guide for current prerequisites and supported configuration details.

=== Constraints imposed :
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 version 6.5 or later
  * Broker and Node roles are mutually exclusive
  * Broker HA load balancing must be external to OSE nodes and therefore can not be configured via this module
  * Avahi and Route53 DNS plugins are not supported
  * ActiveMQ, if clustered, requires 2+ nodes
  * MongoDB replicasets must 3+(2*n) nodes

=== Yum repositories
Configuring yum repositories via this module is not currently supported. Please ensure subscriptions and/or
yum repositories are configured per the deployment guide. https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Enterprise/2/html/Deployment_Guide/Red_Hat_Subscription_Requirements.html

=== TODO
  * Use stored configs to push node dns changes from broker without sharing secrets to nodes
  * Stored configs for districts
  * Broker API key, rsync key?
